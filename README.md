# Alfred-pycharm

Quickly open Pycharm projects via Alfred 3.

This is not as fully featured as [jetbrains-alfred-workflow](https://github.com/bchatard/jetbrains-alfred-workflow), but it is significantly faster with a large number of projects.

## Install

Follow the [create a command line launcher](https://github.com/bchatard/jetbrains-alfred-workflow#requirements) steps from `jetbrains-alfred-workflow`.

Download the [alfred-pycharm.alfredworkflow](https://github.com/orf/alfred-pycharm/raw/master/alfred-pycharm.alfredworkflow) file and install.

Then simply enter `charm [search term]` to find projects.
